# 🎯 Real-Time Object Detection & Tracking Web App

This project is a Flask-based web application that performs real-time object detection and tracking using **YOLOv8** and **Deep SORT**. Users can either upload video files or stream directly from their webcam to detect and track multiple objects with persistent IDs.
